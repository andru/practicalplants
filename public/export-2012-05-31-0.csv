"Alnus incana","Prefers a heavy soil and a damp situation{{Ref | PFAFimport-1}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-11}}. Grows well in heavy clay soils{{Ref | PFAFimport-11}}. Thrives in drier soils than many other members of this genus{{Ref | PFAFimport-200}}. Tolerates very infertile sites{{Ref | PFAFimport-200}}.
This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil micro-organisms, these form nodules on the roots of the plants and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby{{Ref | PFAFimport-200}}.","Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe and only just covered{{Ref | PFAFimport-200}}. Spring sown seed should also germinate successfully so long as it is not covered[200, K]. The seed should germinate in the spring as the weather warms up. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots. If growth is sufficient, it is possible to plant them out into their permanent positions in the summer, otherwise keep them in pots outdoors and plant them out in the spring.
If you have sufficient quantity of seed, it can be sown thinly in an outdoor seed bed in the spring{{Ref | PFAFimport-78}}. The seedlings can either be planted out into their permanent positions in the autumn/winter, or they can be allowed to grow on in the seed bed for a further season before planting them.
Cuttings of mature wood, taken as soon as the leaves fall in autumn, outdoors in sandy soil.","Europe. Introduced in Britain{{Ref | PFAFimport-17}}.","Mountains, especially on poor soil{{Ref | PFAFimport-17}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-50}}.","None known","This species fixes atmospheric nitrogen and is also tolerant of polluted soils, it can be used for land reclamation, especially on coal tips{{Ref | PFAFimport-200}}.
This is an excellent pioneer species for re-establishing woodlands on disused farmland, difficult sites etc. Its fast rate of growth means that it quickly provides sheltered conditions to allow more permanent woodland trees to become established. In addition, bacteria on the roots fix atmospheric nitrogen - whilst this enables the tree to grow well in quite poor soils it also makes some of this nitrogen available to other plants growing nearby. Alder trees also have a heavy leaf canopy and when the leaves fall in the autumn they help to build up the humus content of the soil. Alder seedlings do not compete well in shady woodland conditions and so this species gradually dies out as the other trees become established[K].
The bark and the fruits contain up to 20% tannin{{Ref | PFAFimport-46}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-61}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-223}}.
Wood - light, soft, fairly elastic, easy to split. Used for clogs, bowls, woodcuts etc. Much valued by cabinet makers{{Ref | PFAFimport-46}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-61}}.","None known","None known","No","Grey Alder","Alnus incana","Betulaceae","Alnus","","","","","{{Has part with material use

"Arbutus unedo","Requires a nutrient-rich well-drained moisture-retentive soil in sun or semi-shade and shelter from cold drying winds, especially when young{{Ref | PFAFimport-11}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-200}}. Grows well in heavy clay soils and in dry soils. Most species in this genus require a lime-free soil but this species is fairly lime tolerant{{Ref | PFAFimport-11}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-200}}. Succeeds in fairly exposed maritime positions{{Ref | PFAFimport-166}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-200}}. A tree in a very exposed position at Rosewarne in N. Cornwall was looking rather tattered in April 1987 but it was 4.5 metres tall and carrying a very good crop of immature fruit[K]. Tolerates industrial pollution{{Ref | PFAFimport-200}}.
Plants have withstood temperatures down to -16°c without injury at Kew{{Ref | PFAFimport-11}}. They grow very well in S.W. England, fruiting well in Cornwall{{Ref | PFAFimport-49}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-59}}.
Plants resent root disturbance and are best placed in their final positions whilst young{{Ref | PFAFimport-11}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-134}}. Give them some protection in their first winter.
The strawberry tree flowers in November and December, the fruit takes 12 months to ripen and so the tree carries both mature fruit and flowers at the same time and is incredibly beautiful at this time[K]. The flowers have a soft honey scent{{Ref | PFAFimport-245}}.
There are a number of named varieties{{Ref | PFAFimport-183}} developed for their ornamental value. 'Elfin King', 'Croomei' and 'Rubra' are all small forms that fruit well when small{{Ref | PFAFimport-182}}. The variety 'Rubra' was 1.2 metres tall at Kew in late 1990 and was laden down with fruits and flowers[K]. 'Elfin King' only reaches a height of 1 metre, comes into bearing when young and fruits well{{Ref | PFAFimport-183}}. It is ideal for container culture{{Ref | PFAFimport-183}}. 'Croomei' is said to be a more reliable fruiting form{{Ref | PFAFimport-49}}.","Seed - best surface sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe. Stored seed should be soaked  for 5 - 6 days in warm water and then surface sown in a shady position in a greenhouse{{Ref | PFAFimport-78}}. Do not allow the compost to become dry. 6 weeks cold stratification helps{{Ref | PFAFimport-134}}. The seed usually germinates well in 2 - 3 months at 20°c{{Ref | PFAFimport-134}}. Seedlings are prone to damp off{{Ref | PFAFimport-184}}, they are best transplanted to individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and should be kept well ventilated. Grow them on in a greenhouse for their first winter and then plant out in late spring after the last expected frosts[K].
Basal cuttings in late winter{{Ref | PFAFimport-200}}.
Cuttings of mature wood of the current season's growth, November/December in a frame. Poor percentage{{Ref | PFAFimport-78}}.
Layering of young wood - can take 2 years{{Ref | PFAFimport-1}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-200}}.","S. Europe and S.W. Ireland.","Woodland, scrub and rocky hillsides, often on limestone and sandstone{{Ref | PFAFimport-17}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-45}}.","None known","Tannin is obtained from the leaves, bark and fruit{{Ref | PFAFimport-46}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-61}}. The bark contains 45% tannin{{Ref | PFAFimport-46}}.
Wood - used for turning, Greek flutes etc{{Ref | PFAFimport-89}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-148}}. It makes a good charcoal{{Ref | PFAFimport-4}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-89}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-148}}.","Fruit - raw or cooked. Sweet but insipid{{Ref | PFAFimport-2}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-3}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-5}}. The Latin name 'unedo' means 'I eat one (only)' and suggests that the fruit is not very palatable[K], though another report says that the fruit is so delicious that a person only needs to eat one{{Ref | PFAFimport-245}}. It does have a somewhat gritty skin, but the fruit itself has the texture of a lush tropical fruit and has a delicate pleasant flavour. For those people with sensitive taste buds, this is a fruit that can be enjoyed when eaten in moderate quantities[K]. The fruit contains about 20% sugars and can be used to make delicious and nourishing jams and preserves{{Ref | PFAFimport-7}}. It is ripe in November/December and is about 15mm in diameter. When fully ripe it falls from the tree and so it is advisable to grow the plant in short grass in order to cushion the fall of the fruit[K].","The strawberry tree is little used in herbalism, though it does deserve modern investigation{{Ref | PFAFimport-268}}. All parts of the plant contain ethyl gallate, a substance that possesses strong antibiotic activity against the Mycobacterium bacteria{{Ref | PFAFimport-268}}.
The leaves, bark and root are astringent and diuretic{{Ref | PFAFimport-7}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-46}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-268}}. They are also a renal antiseptic{{Ref | PFAFimport-7}} and so are of use in the treatment of affections of the urinary system such as cystitis and urethritis{{Ref | PFAFimport-254}}. Their astringent action makes them of use in the treatment of diarrhoea and dysentery and, like many other astringent plants, a gargle can be made for treating sore and irritated throats{{Ref | PFAFimport-254}}. The leaves are gathered in the summer and dried for later use{{Ref | PFAFimport-7}}.

"Elaeagnus umbellata","Succeeds in most soils that are well-drained{{Ref | PFAFimport-11}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-200}}, though it dislikes shallow chalk soils{{Ref | PFAFimport-98}}. It prefers a soil that is only moderately fertile, succeeding in very poor soils and in dry soils{{Ref | PFAFimport-11}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-200}}. Prefers a light sandy loam and a sunny position{{Ref | PFAFimport-11}}. Established plants are very drought resistant{{Ref | PFAFimport-1}}.
A very hardy plant, tolerating temperatures down to at least -40°c{{Ref | PFAFimport-200}}.
This species is somewhat similar to E. multiflora, but it flowers a few weeks later{{Ref | PFAFimport-182}}.
Sometimes cultivated for its edible fruit, there are some named varieties{{Ref | PFAFimport-183}}. 'Cardinal' and 'Red Wing' are very good fruiting forms (developed for ornament and not for fruit quality){{Ref | PFAFimport-182}}. 'Jazbo' has been bred for its edible fruits which are said to be ripe when 'they drop into your hand'{{Ref | PFAFimport-214}}. This makes them valuable in breeding programmes to develop easily harvested fruits{{Ref | PFAFimport-214}}.
Flowers are rich in nectar and very aromatic, they are much visited by bees.
Polymorphic{{Ref | PFAFimport-11}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-275}}. This species is notably resistant to honey fungus{{Ref | PFAFimport-88}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-200}}.
Plants can fruit in 6 years from seed{{Ref | PFAFimport-160}}.
This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby{{Ref | PFAFimport-160}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-200}}. An excellent companion plant, when grown in orchards it can increase yields from the fruit trees by up to 10%.","Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame{{Ref | PFAFimport-78}}. It should germinate in late winter or early spring, though it may take 18 months[K]. Stored seed can be very slow to germinate, often taking more than 18 months. A warm stratification for 4 weeks followed by 12 weeks cold stratification can help{{Ref | PFAFimport-98}}. The seed usually (eventually) germinates quite well{{Ref | PFAFimport-78}}. Prick out the seedlings into individual pot as soon as they are large enough to handle and plant out when they are at least 15cm tall.
Cuttings of half-ripe wood, 7 - 10cm with a heel, July/August in a frame. Good percentage{{Ref | PFAFimport-78}}.
Cuttings of mature wood of the current year's growth, 10 - 12cm with a heel, November in a frame. Leave for 12 months. Fair to good percentage{{Ref | PFAFimport-78}}.

Mature bushes in the wild yield about 650g of fruit over 2 - 3 pickings{{Ref | PFAFimport-194}}. The harvested fruit stores for about 15 days at room temperature{{Ref | PFAFimport-194}}. The fruit is about 8mm in diameter{{Ref | PFAFimport-200}} and contains a single large seed[K].
Seed - raw or cooked{{Ref | PFAFimport-194}}. It can be eaten with the fruit though the seed case is rather fibrous{{Ref | PFAFimport-160}}.","The flowers are astringent, cardiac and stimulant{{Ref | PFAFimport-240}}.

"Hippophae rhamnoides turkestanica","Succeeds in most soils{{Ref | PFAFimport-200}}, including poor ones{{Ref | PFAFimport-186}}, so long as they are not too dry{{Ref | PFAFimport-182}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-200}}. Grows well by water and in fairly wet soils{{Ref | PFAFimport-182}}. Established plants are very drought resistant{{Ref | PFAFimport-186}}. Requires a sunny position{{Ref | PFAFimport-3}}, seedlings failing to grow in a shady position and mature shrubs quickly dying if overshadowed by taller plants{{Ref | PFAFimport-186}}. Does well in very sandy soils{{Ref | PFAFimport-1}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-186}}. Plants are very tolerant of maritime exposure{{Ref | PFAFimport-75}}, though they are fairly slow growing{{Ref | PFAFimport-75}}.
Although usually found near the coast in the wild, they thrive when grown inland{{Ref | PFAFimport-11}} and are hardy to about -25°c{{Ref | PFAFimport-184}}. 
A very ornamental plant{{Ref | PFAFimport-1}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-11}}, it is occasionally cultivated, especially in N. Europe, for its edible fruit{{Ref | PFAFimport-183}}.
Members of this genus are attracting considerable interest from breeding institutes for their nutrient-rich fruits that can promote the general health of the body (see edible and medicinal uses below){{Ref | PFAFimport-214}}.
This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby{{Ref | PFAFimport-113}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-186}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-200}}. Plants produce abundant suckers, especially when grown on sandy soils{{Ref | PFAFimport-186}}.
Dioecious. Male and female plants must be grown if seed is required. The sexes of plants cannot be distinguished before flowering, but on flowering plants the buds of male plants in winter are conical and conspicuous whilst female buds are smaller and rounded{{Ref | PFAFimport-11}}.
Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus{{Ref | PFAFimport-200}}.","Seed - sow spring in a sunny position in a cold frame{{Ref | PFAFimport-78}}. Germination is usually quick and good although 3 months cold stratification may improve the germination rate. Alternatively the seed can be sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe in the autumn. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow on in a greenhouse for their first winter. Plant out in late spring into their permanent positions. Male seedlings, in spring, have very prominent axillary buds whilst females are clear and smooth at this time{{Ref | PFAFimport-78}}.
Cuttings of half-ripe wood, June/July in a frame{{Ref | PFAFimport-200}}. Difficult{{Ref | PFAFimport-113}}. This is the easiest method of vegetative propagation{{Ref | PFAFimport-214}}.
Cuttings of mature wood in autumn{{Ref | PFAFimport-200}}. Difficult{{Ref | PFAFimport-113}}. The cuttings should be taken at the end of autumn or very early in the spring before the buds burst. Store them in sand and peat until April, cut into 7 - 9cm lengths and plant them in a plastic tent with bottom heat{{Ref | PFAFimport-214}}. Rooting should take place within 2 months and they can be put in their permanent positions in the autumn{{Ref | PFAFimport-214}}.
Division of suckers in the winter. They can be planted out direct into their permanent positions and usually establish well and quickly[K].
Layering in autumn{{Ref | PFAFimport-200}}.","E. Asia - Himalayas.","Not known","Some reports suggest that the fruit is poisonous{{Ref | PFAFimport-13}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-100}}, whilst it may be very acid it is most definitely not poisonous{{Ref | PFAFimport-65}}.","Very tolerant of maritime exposure{{Ref | PFAFimport-29}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-49}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-75}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-182}}, it can be used as a shelter hedge. It dislikes much trimming{{Ref | PFAFimport-75}}. A very thorny plant, it quickly makes an impenetrable barrier.
Sea buckthorn has an extensive root system and suckers vigorously and so has been used in soil conservation schemes, especially on sandy soils. The fibrous and suckering root system acts to bind the sand{{Ref | PFAFimport-186}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-244}}.
Because the plant grows quickly, even in very exposed conditions, and also adds nitrogen to the soil, it can be used as a pioneer species to help the re-establishment of woodland in difficult areas. Because the plant is very light-demanding it will eventually be out-competed by the woodland trees and so will not out-stay its welcome[K].
The seeds contain 12 - 13% of a slow-drying oil{{Ref | PFAFimport-240}}.
The vitamin-rich fruit juice is used cosmetically in face-masks etc{{Ref | PFAFimport-9}}.
A yellow dye is obtained from the fruit{{Ref | PFAFimport-74}}. A yellow dye is obtained from the stems, root and foliage{{Ref | PFAFimport-4}}.
A blackish-brown dye is obtained from the young leaves and shoots{{Ref | PFAFimport-74}}.
Wood - tough, hard, very durable, fine-grained. Used for fine carpentry, turning etc{{Ref | PFAFimport-46}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-61}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-74}}. The wood is also used for fuel and charcoal{{Ref | PFAFimport-146}}.","Fruit - raw or cooked. Very rich in vitamin C (120mg per 100g){{Ref | PFAFimport-74}} and vitamin A{{Ref | PFAFimport-183}}, but too acid when raw for most peoples tastes{{Ref | PFAFimport-11}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-158}}. Used for making fruit juice, it is high in vitamins and has an attractive aroma{{Ref | PFAFimport-141}}. It is being increasingly used in making fruit juices, especially when mixed with other fruits, because of its reputed health benefits{{Ref | PFAFimport-214}}. The fruits of some species and cultivars (not specified) contain up to 9.2% oil{{Ref | PFAFimport-214}}. The fruit is very freely borne along the stems[K] and is about 6 - 8mm in diameter{{Ref | PFAFimport-200}}. The fruit becomes less acid after a frost or if cooked{{Ref | PFAFimport-74}}. The fruit is ripe from late September and usually hangs on the plants all winter if not eaten by the birds. It is best used before any frosts since the taste and quality of frosted berries quickly deteriorates{{Ref | PFAFimport-214}}.","The twigs and leaves contain 4 - 5% tannin{{Ref | PFAFimport-240}}. They are astringent and vermifuge{{Ref | PFAFimport-7}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-100}}.
The tender branches and leaves contain bio-active substances which are used to produce an oil that is quite distinct from the oil produced from the fruit. This oil is used as an ointment for treating burns{{Ref | PFAFimport-214}}.
A high-quality medicinal oil is made from the fruit and used in the treatment of cardiac disorders, it is also said to be particularly effective when applied to the skin to heal burns, eczema and radiation injury, and is taken internally in the treatment of stomach and intestinal diseases{{Ref | PFAFimport-214}}.
The fruit is used as a tonic{{Ref | PFAFimport-9}}. The freshly-pressed juice is used in the treatment of colds, febrile conditions, exhaustion etc{{Ref | PFAFimport-9}}. The fruit is a very rich source of vitamins and minerals, especially in vitamins A, C and E, flavanoids and other bio-active compounds. It is also a fairly good source of essential fatty acids, which is fairly unusual for a fruit. It is being investigated as a food that is capable of reducing the incidence of cancer and also as a means of halting or reversing the growth of cancers{{Ref | PFAFimport-214}}.","Yes","Sea Buckthorn","Hippophae rhamnoides turkestanica","Elaeagnaceae","Hippophae","","","","{{Has part with edible use

"Juglans regia","Requires a deep well-drained loam{{Ref | PFAFimport-11}} and a sunny position sheltered from strong winds. Prefers a slightly alkaline heavy loam but succeeds in most soils{{Ref | PFAFimport-1}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-63}}. The walnut tree is reported to tolerate an annual precipitation of 31 to 147cm, an annual temperature in the range of 7.0 to 21.1°C and a pH in the range of 4.5 to 8.2{{Ref | PFAFimport-269}}.
The dormant plant is very cold tolerant, tolerating temperatures down to about -27°C without serious damage, but the young spring growth is rather tender and can be damaged by late frosts{{Ref | PFAFimport-269}}. Some late-leafing cultivars have been developed, these often avoid damage from spring frosts and can produce a better quality timber tree.
The walnut tree is frequently cultivated for its edible seed in temperate zones of the world, there are many named varieties{{Ref | PFAFimport-63}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-183}}. Newer cultivars begin producing nuts in 5 - 6 years; by 7 - 8 years, they produce about 2.5 tons of nuts per hectare{{Ref | PFAFimport-269}}. Orchards on relatively poor, unirrigated mountain soil report 1.5 - 2.25 tonnes per hectare, orchards in well cultivated valleys, 6.5 - 7.5 tonnes per hectare{{Ref | PFAFimport-269}}. According to the Wealth of India, a fully grown individual can yield about 185 kg, but 37 kg is more likely{{Ref | PFAFimport-269}}.
Trees grow well in most areas of Britain but they often fail to fully ripen their fruits or their wood in our cooler and damper climate{{Ref | PFAFimport-63}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-200}}, they prefer a more continental climate. There are some very fine trees in Cornwall{{Ref | PFAFimport-59}}. Walnuts can produce large healthy trees in many parts of Britain, but seedling trees often do not fruit reliably. Some European varieties have been developed that succeed in colder areas{{Ref | PFAFimport-200}}. Seedling trees are said to take from 6 to 15 years to come into fruit from seed{{Ref | PFAFimport-200}}, but these cultivars usually start cropping within 5 years.
Plants produce a deep taproot and they are intolerant of root disturbance. Seedlings should be planted out into their permanent positions as soon as possible and given some protection for their first winter or two since they are somewhat tender when young.
Flower initiation depends upon suitable conditions in the previous summer. The flowers and young growths can be destroyed by even short periods down to -2°c{{Ref | PFAFimport-63}}, but fortunately plants are usually late coming into leaf. Some cultivars are self-fertile, though it is generally best to grow at least two different cultivars to assist in cross-pollination.
Any pruning should only be carried out in late summer to early autumn or when the plant is fully dormant otherwise wounds will bleed profusely and this will severely weaken the tree.
Plants produce chemicals which can inhibit the growth of other plants. These chemicals are dissolved out of the leaves when it rains and are washed down to the ground below, reducing the growth of plants under the tree{{Ref | PFAFimport-18}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-20}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-159}}. The roots also produce substances that are toxic to many plant species, especially apples (Malus species), members of the Ericaceae, Potentilla spp and the white pines (certain Pinus spp.){{Ref | PFAFimport-200}}. Trees have a dense canopy which tends to reduce plant growth below them{{Ref | PFAFimport-20}}. All in all, not the best of companion trees, it is also suggested that the trees do not like growing together in clumps{{Ref | PFAFimport-37}}. Trees are said to inhibit the growth of potatoes and tomatoes{{Ref | PFAFimport-18}}.
Hybridizes with J. nigra{{Ref | PFAFimport-149}}.
This species is notably susceptible to honey fungus{{Ref | PFAFimport-200}}.
The bruised leaves have a pleasant sweet though resinous smell{{Ref | PFAFimport-245}}.","The seed is best sown as soon as it is ripe in individual deep pots in a cold frame{{Ref | PFAFimport-80}}. You need to protect it from mice, birds, squirrels etc. The seed usually germinates in late winter or the spring. Plant out the seedlings into their permanent positions in early summer and give some protection from the cold for their first winter or two.
The seed can also be stored in cool moist conditions (such s the salad compartment of a fridge) over the winter and sown in early spring but it may then require a period of cold stratification before it will germinate{{Ref | PFAFimport-78}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-80}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-113}}.
Named varieties are propagated by budding.","E. Europe to N. Asia. More or less naturalized in S. Britain.","Forests in the Himalayas, preferring a northerly aspect in the west but a southerly or westerly aspect in the east of the range{{Ref | PFAFimport-144}}.","None known","A yellow dye is obtained from the green husks{{Ref | PFAFimport-4}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-7}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-100}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-117}}. It is green{{Ref | PFAFimport-148}}. The green nuts (is this the same as the green husks?) and the leaves are also used{{Ref | PFAFimport-148}}. The rind of unripe fruits is a good source of tannin{{Ref | PFAFimport-158}}.
A brown dye is obtained from the leaves and mature husks{{Ref | PFAFimport-4}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-7}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-48}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-117}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-168}}. It does not require a mordant and turns black if prepared in an iron pot{{Ref | PFAFimport-168}}. The dye is often used as a colouring and tonic for dark hair{{Ref | PFAFimport-238}}. The leaves and the husks can be dried for later use{{Ref | PFAFimport-169}}.
A golden-brown dye is obtained from the catkins in early summer. It does not require a mordant{{Ref | PFAFimport-168}}.
A drying oil is obtained from the seed. It is used in soap making, paints, etc. It is not very stable and quickly goes rancid{{Ref | PFAFimport-7}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-21}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-34}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-46}}.
The nuts can be used as a wood polish. Simply crack open the shell and rub the kernel into the wood to release the oils. Wipe off with a clean cloth[4, 6, K].
The dried fruit rind is used to paint doors, window frames etc{{Ref | PFAFimport-145}} (it probably protects the wood due to its tannin content).
The shells may be used as anti-skid agents for tyres, blasting grit, and in the preparation of activated carbon{{Ref | PFAFimport-269}}.
The leaves contain juglone, this has been shown to have pesticidal and herbicidal properties{{Ref | PFAFimport-218}}. The crushed leaves are an insect repellent{{Ref | PFAFimport-46}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-61}}.
Juglone is also secreted from the roots of the tree, it has an inhibitory effect on the growth of many other plants{{Ref | PFAFimport-201}}.
Bark of the tree and the fruit rind are dried and used as a tooth cleaner. They can also be used fresh{{Ref | PFAFimport-145}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-158}}.
Wood - heavy, hard, durable, close grained, seasons and polishes well. A very valuable timber tree, it is used for furniture making, veneer etc{{Ref | PFAFimport-1}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-4}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-7}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-46}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-61}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-158}}.","Seed - eaten raw or used in confections, cakes, ice cream etc{{Ref | PFAFimport-2}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-5}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-12}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-34}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-183}}. A delicious flavour. The seed can also be ground into a meal and used as a flavouring in sweet and savoury dishes{{Ref | PFAFimport-183}}. The unripe fruits are pickled in vinegar{{Ref | PFAFimport-183}}.
An edible oil is obtained from the seed{{Ref | PFAFimport-4}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-7}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-57}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-183}}, it should not be stored for any length of time since it tends to go rancid quickly{{Ref | PFAFimport-7}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-132}}. The oil has a pleasant flavour and is used in salads or for cooking{{Ref | PFAFimport-183}}.
The sap is tapped in spring and used to make a sugar{{Ref | PFAFimport-117}}.
The finely ground shells are used in the stuffing of 'agnolotti' pasta{{Ref | PFAFimport-183}}. They have also been used as adulterant of spices{{Ref | PFAFimport-269}}.
The dried green husks contain 2.5 - 5% ascorbic acid (vitamin C) - this can be extracted and used as a vitamin supplement{{Ref | PFAFimport-269}}.
The leaves are used as a tea{{Ref | PFAFimport-183}}.","The walnut tree has a long history of medicinal use, being used in folk medicine to treat a wide range of complaints{{Ref | PFAFimport-269}}. The leaves are alterative, anthelmintic, anti-inflammatory, astringent and depurative{{Ref | PFAFimport-9}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-218}}. They are used internally the treatment of constipation, chronic coughs, asthma, diarrhoea, dyspepsia etc{{Ref | PFAFimport-9}}. The leaves are also used to treat skin ailments and purify the blood{{Ref | PFAFimport-9}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-218}}. They are considered to be specific in the treatment of strumous sores{{Ref | PFAFimport-240}}.
Male inflorescences are made into a broth and used in the treatment of coughs and vertigo{{Ref | PFAFimport-218}}.
The rind is anodyne and astringent{{Ref | PFAFimport-147}}. It is used in the treatment of diarrhoea and anaemia{{Ref | PFAFimport-238}}.
The seeds are antilithic, diuretic and stimulant{{Ref | PFAFimport-218}}. They are used internally in the treatment of low back pain, frequent urination, weakness of both legs, chronic cough, asthma, constipation due to dryness or anaemia and stones in the urinary tract{{Ref | PFAFimport-176}}. Externally, they are made into a paste and applied as a poultice to areas of dermatitis and eczema{{Ref | PFAFimport-176}}.
The oil from the seed is anthelmintic{{Ref | PFAFimport-218}}. It is also used in the treatment of menstrual problems and dry skin conditions{{Ref | PFAFimport-238}}.
The cotyledons are used in the treatment of cancer{{Ref | PFAFimport-218}}. Walnut has a long history of folk use in the treatment of cancer, some extracts from the plant have shown anticancer activity{{Ref | PFAFimport-218}}.
The bark and root bark are anthelmintic, astringent and detergent{{Ref | PFAFimport-218}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-240}}.

"Prunus cerasus","Thrives in a well-drained moisture-retentive loamy soil{{Ref | PFAFimport-11}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-200}}. Prefers some lime in the soil but is likely to become chlorotic if too much lime is present{{Ref | PFAFimport-1}}. Prefers an acid soil according to another report{{Ref | PFAFimport-5}}. Succeeds in sun or partial shade though it fruits better in a sunny position{{Ref | PFAFimport-11}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-200}}. Plants are succeeding in a fairly exposed maritime position at Rosewarne in N. Cornwall[K].
Plants are hardy to about -20°c{{Ref | PFAFimport-184}}.
Long cultivated for its edible fruit, there are many named varieties{{Ref | PFAFimport-1}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-50}}. See separate entries for the various sub-species[K]. It is also a parent, with P. avium, of many cultivars of sweet cherries{{Ref | PFAFimport-1}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-17}}. Many cultivars will succeed on a north or east facing wall{{Ref | PFAFimport-219}}.
Most members of this genus are shallow-rooted and will produce suckers if the roots are damaged{{Ref | PFAFimport-238}}. Plants produce suckers freely{{Ref | PFAFimport-184}}.
Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus{{Ref | PFAFimport-200}}.","Seed - requires 2 - 3 months cold stratification and is best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe{{Ref | PFAFimport-200}}. Sow stored seed in a cold frame as early in the year as possible{{Ref | PFAFimport-200}}. Protect the seed from mice etc. The seed can be rather slow, sometimes taking 18 months to germinate{{Ref | PFAFimport-113}}. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Grow them on in a greenhouse or cold frame for their first winter and plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year.
Cuttings of half-ripe wood with a heel, July/August in a frame{{Ref | PFAFimport-113}}.
Softwood cuttings from strongly growing plants in spring to early summer in a frame.
Layering in spring.
Division of suckers during the dormant season. They can be planted out direct into their permanent positions.","S.E. Europe to W. Asia. Naturalized in Britain.","Hedges in S. England{{Ref | PFAFimport-17}}.","Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, it belongs to a genus where most, if not all members of the genus produce hydrogen cyanide, a poison that gives almonds their characteristic flavour. This toxin is found mainly in the leaves and seed and is readily detected by its bitter taste. It is usually present in too small a quantity to do any harm but any very bitter seed or fruit should not be eaten. In small quantities, hydrogen cyanide has been shown to stimulate respiration and improve digestion, it is also claimed to be of benefit in the treatment of cancer. In excess, however, it can cause respiratory failure and even death.","An edible drying oil obtained from the seed is also used in cosmetics{{Ref | PFAFimport-61}}.
The gum obtained from the stem is also used as an adhesive{{Ref | PFAFimport-61}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-64}}.
Plants can be grown as a hedge{{Ref | PFAFimport-50}}, succeeding in fairly exposed positions[K].
A green dye can be obtained from the leaves{{Ref | PFAFimport-168}}.
A dark grey to green dye can be obtained from the fruit{{Ref | PFAFimport-168}}.","Fruit - raw or cooked{{Ref | PFAFimport-1}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-2}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-5}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-11}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-12}}. Pleasantly acid, the fruit can be eaten out of hand, used in pies, preserves etc or dried for later use{{Ref | PFAFimport-183}}. The fruit is about 18mm in diameter and contains one large seed{{Ref | PFAFimport-200}}.
Seed - raw or cooked. Do not eat the seed if it is too bitter - see the notes above on toxicity.
An edible oil is obtained from the seed{{Ref | PFAFimport-46}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-61}}. When refined it is used as a salad oil{{Ref | PFAFimport-183}}.
The leaves are used as a tea substitute{{Ref | PFAFimport-46}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-61}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-183}}.
A gum obtained from the trunk is used for chewing{{Ref | PFAFimport-61}}{{Ref | PFAFimport-64}}.","The bark is astringent, bitter and febrifuge{{Ref | PFAFimport-240}}. An infusion of the bark has been used in the treatment of fevers, coughs and colds{{Ref | PFAFimport-257}}. The root bark has been used as a wash for old sores and ulcers{{Ref | PFAFimport-257}}.
The seed is nervine{{Ref | PFAFimport-240}}.
Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, all members of the genus contain amygdalin and prunasin, substances which break down in water to form hydrocyanic acid (cyanide or prussic acid). In small amounts this exceedingly poisonous compound stimulates respiration, improves digestion and gives a sense of well-being{{Ref | PFAFimport-238}}.","No","Sour Cherry","Prunus cerasus","Rosaceae","Prunus","","","","{{Has part with edible use
