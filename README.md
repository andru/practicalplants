PracticalPlants.org
===============

This repository is the webroot of Practical Plants (practicalplants.org). It contains MediaWiki and Vanilla forums and 
a lot of extensions. At the moment there's no documentation, and we're working on releasing most of the custom extensions
as GPL'd code, so this repository is only really of interest to anyone actively working on the Practical Plants website.

Please note that the Practical Plants skin and logo are NOT openly licensed and are copyright of Andru Vallance
